# More Classes and Objects
Project done during **ALX Software Engineering Scholarship 2022** at **Alx Students Education**. It aims to learn about object oriented programming (OOP), Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, instances and classes attributes in **Python**.

## Resources
* [Object Oriented Programming (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded))](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html)

* [Object-Oriented Programming (Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows the way you should not use or write a class, in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read only the following paragraphs: “General Introduction,” “First-class Everything,” “A Minimal Class in Python,” “Attributes,” “Methods,” “The __init__ Method,” “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “__str__- and __repr__-Methods,” “Public- Protected- and Private Attributes,” & “Destructor”)](https://python-course.eu/oop/object-oriented-programming.php)

* [Class and Instance Attributes](https://python-course.eu/oop/class-instance-attributes.php)

* [classmethods and staticmethods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq8cL2XMM5M)

* [Properties vs. Getters and Setters (Mainly the last part “Public instead of Private Attributes”)](https://python-course.eu/oop/properties-vs-getters-and-setters.php)

* [str vs repr](https://shipit.dev/posts/python-str-vs-repr.html)

## Technologies
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.9.7
* C files are compiled using `gcc 9.8.4`
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
