# Import & modules
Project done during **ALX Software Engineering Scholarship 2022** at **Alx Students Education**. It aims to learn how to import functions, how to create modules and how to use command line arguments in **Python**.

## Technologies
* Shell Scripts are written in Bash 4.4.23(2)
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.9.7
* C files are compiled using `gcc 9.8.4`
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Py files checked with pycodestyle 2.8.0
